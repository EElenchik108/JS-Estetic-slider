			<h3>Perfectly grill</h3>
			<p>The lights of stars that were extinguished ages ago still reaches us. So it is with great men who died centuries ago, but still reach us with the radiations of their personalities.</p>

			<h3>Fine tray</h3>
			<p>And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter and the sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.</p>

			<h3>Wonderful telescope</h3>
			<p>Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.

			It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding.</p>

			<h3>Delightfully style</h3>
			<p>Yes, there is a Nirvana; it is leading your sheep to a green pasture, and in putting your child to sleep, and in writing the last line of your poem.</p>
